# Equator-Utils

**Equator Utils** is the sub-library of **[Equator.](https://github.com/KrLite/Equator)**
This library provides a set of utilities, not only can be used in rendering but also in other common environments.

## Implementation

The easiest way of implementing this library is to use **[JitPack.](https://jitpack.io/#KrLite/Equator-Utils)**

Add the content below to your `build.gradle:`

```groovy
repositories {
	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
	implementation "com.github.KrLite:Equator-Utils:v{x}"
}
```

> The `v{x}` above should be replaced by the latest [`Jitpack version`](https://jitpack.io/#KrLite/Equator-Utils) of **Equator Utils.**
